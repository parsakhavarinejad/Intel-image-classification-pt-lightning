# Intel Image Classification with PyTorch Lightning  

This project demonstrates how to build and train an image classification model using a pretrained **ResNet18** on the **Intel Image Classification dataset**. We leverage **PyTorch Lightning** to streamline the training process.

## üìú Description  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process of:  

- Loading and exploring the Intel Image Classification dataset.  
- Defining a custom PyTorch `Dataset` and a PyTorch Lightning `DataModule` for data handling.  
- Building a classification model using a pretrained ResNet18.  
- Training and validating the model with PyTorch Lightning.
